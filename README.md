# rvm-ree-rhel

* RVM
* CENTOS 7
* Ruby enterprise edition
* RubyGems 1.4.2

This is minimal image, which means, I've removed all developer tools after ruby compilation is finished.
So if you need to compile some gems don't forget to add developer tools from yum. Check dockerfile for details how it's done.
